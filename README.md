# Sassy Swine 2.0

Sassy Swine is a Gulpified task runner suite for quickly getting started on a new web project, using:
 * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
 * [SASS](http://www.sass-lang.com/)
 * [AngularJS 1.5.8](http://angularjs.org/)
 * [Pug](https://pugjs.org)

## Special thanks to
[Todd Motto](https://github.com/toddmotto/) for building [FireShell](https://github.com/toddmotto/fireshell) which was what initially unlocked my discovery path into [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)!

The online works of [John Pappa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and [Mark Goodyear](https://gist.github.com/markgoodyear) were also massive help and inspiration.

## Prerequisite software

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
* [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) (Windows)

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have installed the *Prerequisite Software*
2. Clone/Download the latest stable release of Sassy Swine into the root directory of your new project.
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:jasonrundell/sassyswine.git new_project_folder
    ```
3. Open `new_project_folder` 
4. (Mac/Linux) Open Terminal (Windows) Node/Ruby/Git Bash terminal and run `npm install` to install all the necessary modules for node.
5. Run `gulp` and your browser should open up with your new project ready to go!
