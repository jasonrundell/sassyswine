# Sassy Swine

Gruntified task runner suite for AngularJS MVC web applications.

An opinionated development suite. Made with modern browsers in mind (no support for older browsers).

### Special thanks to [Todd Motto](https://github.com/toddmotto/) for building [FireShell](https://github.com/toddmotto/fireshell) which was what initially unlocked my discovery path into [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)!

## Getting started with Sassy Swine

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the latest stable release of Sassy Swine into the root directory of your new project.
3. Open Terminal or Command prompt with Node.js/Ruby.
4. (ONLY AFTER YOUR FIRST CLONE) Run `npm install` to install all the necessary modules for node.
5. Run `grunt` build local development quality assets and your browser should open up with your new project ready to go!
6. Run `grunt build` to build production quality assets.
7. (FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY) Run `grunt push` to publish directly to your production environment (use with wisdom!)
